litemapy by SmylerMC: https://github.com/SmylerMC/litemapy

# how to use:
- input a file-path pointing to your schematic folder
- input the name of your rom litematic without the extension
- input the name of your pattern litematic without the extension (make sure the schematic does not contain any air blocks around your pattern)
- input the name of the generated litematic without the extension
- input the amount of hexits to use per block
- input a block to replace in the litematic (default is 'minecraft:beacon')
- input the litematic version (1-6)
- the script should now generate a litematic file and place it into your litematic folder
